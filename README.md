# Clinical Informatics for the Modern Medical Student (CIMMS)

## Course Syllabus and Manifest

Suggested advanced preparation: 
•	R4DS by Hadley Wickham (the father of modern data mining) 
o	Will assign sections in github weekly from this resource as well as other books/articles
•	Downloading/Setting up R: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
o	Work through this to understand the “flavor” of code. I would love if everyone could come in with an understanding of variables, methods, values, and object types to make discussions a little smoother.
In this series of lunch lectures and problem sets students will learn to identify, clean and analyze robust clinical datasets utilizing R. This series and the skillsets developed will aim to provide students with the knack to think computationally and run multi-level analyses to answer biological questions. Understanding these topics will enable students to apply their basic science education to answer complex, clinical questions. 
Course Objectives:
•	Identify computational resources available for clinical, basic, and translational research
•	Conduct data cleaning procedures as per R4DS
•	Export publicly available data resources
•	Conduct robust analyses for a variety of use cases
Teaching Style: Lecture (10 min MAX) + Group Problem Sets (45 minutes)
We will attempt to make this course more of a flipped-classroom model. Lectures will predominantly aim to describe statistics and principles behind the code (ChatGPT can’t do that). Group problem sets will be an exciting opportunity to apply our learning. I will identify datasets and provide a set of challenging questions that can only be answered by coding and cannot be answered with GPT. In groups students will grapple with these questions and work together to come up with a script that answers each question. This process of wrangling with questions will impart some important computational wisdom. By the end of the day, I will release an answer key to our class github for those interested.
