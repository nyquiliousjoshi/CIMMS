# Clinical Informatics for the Modern Medical Student (CIMMS)

## Course Syllabus and Manifest

# Clinical Data Analysis with R

## Overview

This repository supports a lunch-time lecture and problem-set series designed to introduce students to identifying, cleaning, and analyzing real-world clinical datasets using **R**. The course emphasizes computational thinking and multi-level analytical approaches to answer biologically and clinically relevant questions.

By the end of the series, students will be able to apply their basic science education to complex clinical and translational research problems.

## Suggested Advanced Preparation

- **R for Data Science (R4DS)** — Hadley Wickham  
  - Weekly sections will be assigned via GitHub, along with additional articles and resources.

- **R & RStudio Setup**  
  - Follow: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html  
  - Students are encouraged to arrive with a basic understanding of:
    - Variables  
    - Functions / methods  
    - Values  
    - Object types  

---

## Course Objectives

- Identify computational resources for:
  - Clinical research  
  - Basic science research  
  - Translational research
- Perform data cleaning using best practices outlined in *R4DS*
- Export and work with publicly available datasets
- Conduct robust analyses across a variety of clinical and biological use cases

## Teaching Format

**Lecture (≤10 minutes) + Group Problem Sets (45 minutes)**

This course follows a **flipped-classroom** model:

- Lectures focus on the statistical concepts and analytical principles underlying the code
- Group problem sets emphasize hands-on application using real datasets

Students will work collaboratively to answer challenging questions that require original coding and cannot be solved using generative AI tools alone. The goal is to build genuine computational intuition through active problem solving.

---

## Datasets & Solutions

- Curated datasets and weekly problem sets will be provided
- A complete answer key will be released to the class GitHub repository after each session for independent review

---

## Expectations

- Active participation in group work  
- Willingness to struggle productively with unfamiliar problems  
- Collaboration and curiosity are strongly encouraged
